Workflow
> Importing the libraries.
> Now let’s define the title and size of our application. Note that in the code below I will set both the height and width of the resizable function as True(1,1) 
  if you want a fixed window and don’t want to maximize or minimize the output you can set it to False(0,0).
> Now I will define the font of the time and its colour, its border width and the background colour of the digital clock.
> Now I will combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application.
> Now let’s define the main function of our digital clock. Here I will set the text of the label as the realtim.
